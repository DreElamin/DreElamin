## Hi there 👋

My name is Elamin, and I am a junior at Emory University studying Data Science, Computer Science, Economics, and Theater. I am interested in all things Python & Data Science!

Growing up in Sudan, where access to technology wasn’t always guaranteed, shaped the way I see the internet and data. I’m especially interested in building tools that make technology more accessible, meaningful, and empowering.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Strides, building a webapp that allows users to unlock a map by traveling to the location.
